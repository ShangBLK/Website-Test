# Website-Test
practice making a website

The internet is an unlimited source of information. We want an easy way to sort through and find news articles specific to the following three categories: 

Entertainment 
Sports
Technology
Imagine you had the chance to create a web application that would allow users to search through global news in order to locate news pertaining to the three categories listed above. How would you go about creating such an app?

NOTE: 

Applicants are responsible for creating a front end app only.
The challenge will be judged via desktop only (not mobile).
Deliverables
We would like you to build a web application using News API that will help users find their desired news. We want to see your creativity in action! Just make sure your solutions include these requirements: 

Submit a deployed web application and include both your website URL and the supporting Github repository. 
The app must use News API as the exclusive data source.
Your app should limit searches to the following three categories: entertainment, sports, and technology. Any news not belonging to one of the approved categories should be filtered accordingly.
Your app should display search results in a user-friendly format that provides information about the news article (headline, source, date, etc). Be sure to include a link to the article that opens in a new tab/window.
Considerations:

If a resource is not accessible, the return code should be addressed.
Images fetched from URLs are various sizes, so care should be given with re-sizing images displayed.
Feel free to go above and beyond these requirements as you build your solution! Here are some other features to consider: 

Display images and descriptions returned by the API in a clever or visually pleasing way
Extra Credit will be given for detecting which articles are behind paywalls and displaying an indication of a paywall.
Submissions will be graded on the following criteria:
